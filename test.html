            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Krzysztof Krakowski. I am assistant professor of political science at the Collegio Carlo Alberto, and a guest researcher in the Department of Social Sciences at the University of Bern. In January 2024, I will be joining King's College London as a lecturer (assistant professor) in the Department of Political Economy. I received my PhD in 2018 from the European University Institute, where I was awarded Josip Peić Prize for the best thesis in Political and Social Sciences. My research focuses on comparative politics and political economy. I am specially interested in political and intergroup conflict.</p>
